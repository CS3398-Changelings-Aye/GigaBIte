Research log regarding Youtube functionality: 

  It was found that we would be able to return a more stylized list of results and references from youtube searches but the time
  consumption versus time left was too much of a disparage. It was decided that it might be a bit easier to create a cross reference tool that
  searches one of our complete databases while also searching youtube and gives you a recipe and video at the same time. While it is 
  not tested in theory the code should work as intended but unfortunately all that was attempted to do could not be completed. But what 
  has been done is currently logged and updated.
