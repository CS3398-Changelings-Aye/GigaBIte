  ## Description:
  We are creating a Discord Bot that is able to search for recipes with a certain ingredient. This will be for those who love to cook or what to love to cook but don't have time or the knowledge to find recipes on their own. It is being done in order to offer a simplistic and easy way to obtain a variety of different recipes without the hastle of searching through blogs. 
  
  ## Status
  * InProgress: Beta Testing. 
  * Our bot Currently has functionality on a small number of servers and can complete simple tasks to engage the user and return recipes from a database as well as search the web for more specific ingredients or recipes and return the data.

## Contributions
* Nicole Runas: Help menu and friendly user interface, including friendly repsonses and an icon for the Bot. These help the Bot appear                   welcoming to users and serve to make the Bot feel more like an actual person. I also found an ingredient database to be                 used for the Bot to complete searches against. The databse is used whenever a user send an ingredient to the                             Bot.Artifacts corresposnging to these can separately be found in the branch Lo and integreated into the cogs file on the                 master branch.
