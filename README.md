 [![Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CS3398-Changelings-Aye/CS3398-Changelings-S2019/master/LogoMakr_3yOZ1T.png)](https://discord.gg/3EWYfUb)
  
  ## Description:
  We are creating a Discord Bot that is able to search for recipes with a certain ingredient. This will be for those who love to cook or what to love to cook but don't have time or the knowledge to find recipes on their own. It is being done in order to offer a simplistic and easy way to obtain a variety of different recipes without the hastle of searching through blogs. 
  
  ## Status
  * InProgress: Beta Testing. 
  * Our bot Currently has functionality on a small number of servers and can complete simple tasks to engage the user and return recipes from a database as well as search the web for more specific ingredients or recipes and return the data.

## General Info
  If you would like to invite the bot to your discord, [Please Click Here](https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=623906771500662795&permissions=0&scope=bot)

## Technologies
* PC's
* [Discord Bot](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/)
* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [Discord API](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html)
* [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com)
* [AirTable](https://airtable.com/universe/expHZcS7kWEyq5gUH/recipe-database)

## Features
* Show Searching: Allows the user to search for a show.
* Recipe Searching: Allows the user to search for a recipe with given Ingredients.
* Ingredient choosing: Allows user to search for recipes using one specific ingredient.
* Meats choosing: Allows users to choose a kind of meat additionaly to ingredients and finding the best recipe for you.
* Meal Type Choosing: Allows the user the choose what type of meal they're looking for. Healthy, vegan, protein, etc.
* Recipe Saving: Allows a user to save a limited number of recipes to a Favorites Database.

## Contributions
* Nicole Runas: Help menu and friendly user interface, including friendly repsonses and an icon for the Bot. These help the Bot appear                   welcoming to users and serve to make the Bot feel more like an actual person. I also found an ingredient database to be                 used for the Bot to complete searches against. The databse is used whenever a user send an ingredient to the                             Bot. Artifacts corresposnging to these can separately be found in the branch Lo and integreated into the cogs file on the                 master branch.

* Dalton Melivlle:

* Sebastian Santana: Researching how to implement a .io database so that the discord bot can either use beautiful soup or some other method to find recipes with that database. Also created and helped edit and organize some of the basic discord code as well as researching and learning the varios discord API methods. Lastly coded a basic user calling function for the discord bot to attempt and familiarize myself with the API more. 
 
* Nisa Lateef: Found a database that is used as a way to allow the user to access basic categories that they desire for their recipe. Coded a welcome page that introduces the bot and it's authors. Also found another database that can be used for recipes to expand the amount of ingridents the bot can recommend.

## Next Steps
 * Dalton Melville:
 * Nicole Runas: Continue to learn more about coding in Python and help expand the online searching functionality of the bot.
 * Sebastian Santana: Continue database research and Push more into the programming aspect.
 * Nisa Lateef: Enhancing my skills in python, and further applying them into the project, as well as expanding the bot's                     functionality.

 ## Retrospective
 What Went Well or maybe not?
 * Team needs to communicate more as well as outline tasks and assess what everyone can and can not do. The basic creation of the bot went relatively well but we need to wor on overall group understanding. The group should try and meet every week to discuss goals and updates on the project outside of class for at least 1 hour. 
 
 
(Team) Four or more team bullets
* We we're able to get a considerable amount done, even though we had more we wanted to do. We were able to get some fully functional code and have the bot work.
* We had many great ideas that need to be expanded upon and borken down more into workable points for the next sprint.
* Different team memebers not familiar with the programming language stepped up and contributed code to the overall project, furthering the team's progress and their own understanding.
* Team memebers were individually proactive and assigned themseles previously unassigned tasks to further along the project.


(Individual) One bullet per team member.
* Dalton Melivlle:

* Nicole Runas: I feel like I was able to get more comfortable wokring in a new coding language and trying to utilize using new design patterns.

* Sebastian Santana: I feel like I learned a lot of the basic fundamentals during this sprint but due to a lack of communication I feel like a lot of time was not very well spent on my end. I need to push for better communication with my team and learn to manage time better.

* Nisa Lateef: I had coded in python before for a bit, but applying the skills I had learned to code a discord bot was interesting. I was able to feel more comfortable with using a different language then the ones I normally use. In the future, I would like to manage my time better, and communicate better with the team whenever I am stuck.

* Wilson Benitez: 

What Might Be Impeding Us from Performing Better?
  (Team) One or more team bullets
  * The team need to find time where everyone can meet outside of class to discuss the project.
  
What Can We do to Improve?

(Team) One or more team bullets
* Meet outside of class
* Communicate when commits/changes are being made
* Notify the team when stuggling with a certain aspect of their assigned task
* Ask teammates questions and communicate about any roadbloacks


(Individual) One bullet per team member with specific,
measurable improvement action described

* Nicole Runas: To improve my skills, I will attempt to create my own dscord bots outside of the class and try to expland their functionality to learn more about integrating bots with apis and utilizing other design patters. I will upload key bits of working code onto my personal repositories to track my progress.

* Dalton Melivlle:

* Sebastian Santana: Communicate and meet up more. We need to be able to understand where and what everyone is doing or how they are understanding the project. 

* Nisa Lateef: Once a week, it's important to meet up with the team so we can discuss the project and help out whenever someone doesn't understand something.
