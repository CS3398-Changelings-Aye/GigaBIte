  ## Description:
  We are creating a Discord Bot that is able to search for recipes with a certain ingredient. This will be for those who love to cook or what to love to cook but don't have time or the knowledge to find recipes on their own. It is being done in order to offer a simplistic and easy way to obtain a variety of different recipes without the hastle of searching through blogs. 
  
  ## Status
  * InProgress: Beta Testing. 
  * Our bot Currently has functionality on a small number of servers and can complete simple tasks to engage the user and return recipes from a database as well as search the web for more specific ingredients or recipes and return the data.

## Technologies
* PC's
* [Discord Bot](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/)
* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [Discord API](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html)
* [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com)
* [AirTable](https://airtable.com/universe/expHZcS7kWEyq5gUH/recipe-database)

## Features
* Show Searching: Allows the user to search for a show.
* Recipe Searching: Allows the user to search for a recipe with given Ingredients.
* Ingredient choosing: Allows user to search for recipes using one specific ingredient.
* Meats choosing: Allows users to choose a kind of meat additionaly to ingredients and finding the best recipe for you.
* Meal Type Choosing: Allows the user the choose what type of meal they're looking for. Healthy, vegan, protein, etc.
* Recipe Saving: Allows a user to save a limited number of recipes to a Favorites Database.

## Contributions
* Nicole Runas: Help menu and friendly user interface, including friendly repsonses and an icon for the Bot. These help the Bot appear                   welcoming to users and serve to make the Bot feel more like an actual person. I also found an ingredient database to be                 used for the Bot to complete searches against. The databse is used whenever a user send an ingredient to the                             Bot.Artifacts corresposnging to these can separately be found in the branch Lo and integreated into the cogs file on the                 master branch.

* Dalton Melivlle:

* Sebastian Santana: Researching how to implement a .io database so that the discord bot can either use beautiful soup or some other method to find recipes with that database. Also created and helped edit and organize some of the basic discord code as well as researching and learning the varios discord API methods. Lastly coded a basic user calling function for the discord bot to attempt and familiarize myself with the API more. 
 
* Nisa Lateef: Found a database that is used as a way to allow the user to access basic categories that they desire for their recipe. Coded a welcome page that introduces the bot and it's authors.

 * Sebastian Santana: Continue database research and Push more into the programming aspect.

 ## Retrospective
 What Went Well or maybe not?
 * Team desperately needs to communicate more as well as outline tasks and assess what everyone can and can not do. The basic creation of the bot went relatively well but it seems that a majority of our group does not understand the code or is a bit confused on the aspect. The group should try and meet every week to discuss goals and updates on the project outside of class for at least 1 hour. 
 
 
(Team) Four or more team bullets
* We we're able to get a considerable amount done, even though we had more we wanted to do. We were able to get some fully functional code and have the bot work.


(Individual) One bullet per team member.
* Dalton Melivlle:
* Nicole Runas:
* Sebastian Santana: I feel like I learned a lot of the basic fundamentals during this sprint but due to a lack of communication I feel like a lot of time was not very well spent on my end. I need to push for better communication with my team and learn to manage time better.
* Wilson Benitez: 

What Might Be Impeding Us from Performing Better?
  (Team) One or more team bullets
  
What Can We do to Improve?

(Team) One or more team bullets

(Individual) One bullet per team member with specific,
measurable improvement action described

* Dalton Melivlle:

* Nicole Runas:

* Sebastian Santana: Communicate and meet up more. We need to be able to understand where and what everyone is doing or how they are understanding the project.
